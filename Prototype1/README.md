# Simple driving game
This is a 3rd person driving game where you and a friend race to the end trying to avoid all obstacles.

 ## Camera
 In this project i coded the camera to follow both the players:![camera](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96641564/176328921-642c2d1a-d591-415b-bb05-8f2a8cbf257e.gif)

 
 I made the camera so you can switch between cameras while playing c for player 1 and f for player 2:![switching cameras](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96641564/176329078-407344fd-a8ec-4116-8397-b8c822cbf4c5.gif)

 ## Obstacles
 I made it so there are multiple obstacles in the way as well as opposing cars:![obstacles](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96641564/176329307-510fc10a-4590-4ea7-83a7-7f75a49b3302.gif)
 ## Multiplayer
 I made the game locally multiplayer, so that someone can play with you on the same keyboard, player 1 using wasd and player 2 using ijkl:![proto1gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96641564/176329320-74243da7-1601-4e84-b9b6-ddc3e298b084.gif)
you can see all the code in the scripts folder
